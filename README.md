This project is a dynamic book reservation system that enables users to search, reserve, and manage books while supporting secure user authentication, session handling and a search functionality built with PHP and MySQL. CRUD operations are implemented to handle books, user profiles, and reservations. The application is developed using PHP (server-side scripting), MySQL, and phpMyAdmin for database management. Session management is implemented to maintain user state securely across pages. Users can register, log in, and manage their book reservations.
